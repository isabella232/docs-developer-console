This documentation describes <%= vars.product_full %>.
<%= vars.product_short %> currently enables platform teams to curate a single set of brokered
services for use by app teams.

## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

This alpha version of <%= vars.product_short %> enables platform teams to register and curate Open
Service Broker API (OSBAPI) compliant service brokers, running anywhere, from a single centralized
location.

App teams can then use these brokers to provision services and retrieve credentials
through the <%= vars.product_short %> command line interface (CLI) tool.
The apps use these credentials to access the service instances, even if the apps exist across multiple
runtime environments, such as <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> and <%= vars.k8s_runtime_full %>.

<p class="note">
    <strong>Note:</strong> The <%= vars.product_short %> team is especially keen for user feedback on
    the use of credentials by apps.
</p>

## <a id='features'></a> Key Features

<%= vars.product_short %> can:

* Register OSBAPI-compliant brokers
* Provide isolation for services within different app projects
* Create services and access them across multiple runtime environments
