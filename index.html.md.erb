<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

<p class="note warning">
  <strong>Warning:</strong>
  <%= vars.product_full %> is currently in alpha and is intended for evaluation and test purposes only. The product is only available to early adopters, please get in touch with the <a href="mailto:pdc-feedback@pivotal.io"><%= vars.product_full %> team</a>, if you would like to know more.
  This product is not currently intended for production environments. Please do not use this product in a <%= vars.platform_old %> production environment.
</p>

This documentation describes <%= vars.product_full %> (<%= vars.product_abbr %>).
<%= vars.product_short %> currently enables platform teams to curate a single set of brokered services for use by app teams.

## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

<%= vars.product_abbr %> allows platform teams to curate and register Open Service Broker API (OSBAPI)
compliant service brokers running anywhere, as long as they are accessible by <%= vars.product_abbr %>, to a
single centralized location.

These brokers can then be used by app teams to provision services and retrieve credentials, through the `pdc` command line tool (CLI). Their apps, which could exist across multiple runtimes, such as Pivotal Platform and Pivotal Container Service, can then use
these credentials to access the service instances.

<p class="note">
    <b>Note:</b>
    The use of credentials by applications is in the early stages of development, and we are seeking feedback on the user experience of this in particular as a high priority.
</p>

## <a id='features'></a> Key Features

<%= vars.product_full %> can:

* Register OSBAPI compliant brokers
* Provide isolation for services within different application projects
* Create services and access them across multiple runtimes
