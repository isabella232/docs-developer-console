<p class="note warning">
  <strong>Warning:</strong>
  <%= vars.product_full %> is currently in alpha and is intended for evaluation and test purposes only.
  Do not use this product in a <%= vars.platform_old %> production environment.
</p>

This documentation describes <%= vars.product_full %> (<%= vars.product_abbr %>).
<%= vars.product_short %> enables platform teams to curate a set of brokered services for use by app teams across many platforms, such as Kubernetes and <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>.

## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

<%= vars.product_abbr %> allows platform teams to curate and register Open Service Broker API (OSBAPI)
compliant service brokers running anywhere, as long as they are accessible by <%= vars.product_abbr %>, to a
single centralized location.

These brokers can then be used by app teams to provision services and retrieve credentials, through the
`pdc` command line tool (CLI). Their apps, which could exist across multiple platforms, can then use
these credentials to access the service instances.

## <a id='features'></a> Key Features

<%= vars.product_full %> can:

* Register OSBAPI compliant brokers
* Create and access services on apps running across multiple platforms
* Have a Docker image registry that images can be relocated to.
