### Known Issues

This release has the following issues:

* The [Install the CNAB](installing.html#install-cnab) steps fail if `REGISTRY-PASSWORD` contains a
`$` character.

* If you remove a user's last remaining group membership in a backing identity provider, such as
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), the User Account and Authentication (UAA) server does
not reflect this change.
This can result in the UAA server generating tokens for users that grant permissions for groups that
the users are not in anymore.
This is a UAA issue.
To prevent this issue, create a group that grants no permissions and assign a user to that group before
removing the rest of that user's group memberships.

* Service instances cannot be created for any brokers registered with a name of more than 63 characters.

* Binding to a Cloud Foundry app fails if the app name and the binding name combined have more than 49
characters.
