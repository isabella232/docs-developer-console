## <a id="0-2-0"></a> v0.2.0â€“alpha.2

**Release Date:** February 21, 2020


### Features

New features and changes in this release:

* Adds the `pdc project list` command to enable app developers to view the projects that they have
access to

* Prevents the creation of projects with the same name as an existing namespace

* Validates that the project exists when a user runs `pdc project use`

* Renames `pdc broker delete` as `pdc broker deregister` to make it more consistent with other CLI command names


### Resolved Issues

This release has the following fix:

* The Kubernetes API version for Project CRD (custom resource definition) is now correctly labelled
v1alpha1, reflecting its alpha status.


### Known Issues

This release has the following issues:

* The [Install the CNAB](installing.html#install-cnab) steps fail if `REGISTRY-PASSWORD` contains a
`$` character.

* If you remove a user's last remaining group membership in a backing identity provider, such as
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), the User Account and Authentication (UAA) server does
not reflect this change.
This can result in the UAA server generating tokens for users that grant permissions for groups that
the users are not in anymore.
This is a UAA issue.
To prevent this issue, create a group that grants no permissions and assign a user to that group before
removing the rest of that user's group memberships.

* You cannot create service instances for any brokers registered with a name of more than 63 characters.

**Release Date:** December 6, 2019

### Features

The initial alpha release enables:

* Registering of Open Service Broker API (OSBAPI) compliant service brokers
* Assignment of app teams to projects for isolation purposes
* Provisioning of instances within a project
* Creation of bindings for instances and retrieval of the credentials

### Known Issues

This release has the following issues:

* The Kubernetes API version for the Project custom resource definition (CRD) is v1.
  However, the API might still be unstable.

* The [Install the CNAB](installing.html#install-cnab) steps fail if `REGISTRY-PASSWORD` contains a `$` character.

* If you remove a user's last remaining group membership in a backing identity provider, such as
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP), the User Account and Authentication (UAA) server does
not reflect this change.
This can result in the UAA server generating tokens for users that grant permissions for groups that
the users are not in anymore.
This is a UAA issue.
To prevent this issue, create a group that grants no permissions and assign a user to that group before
removing the rest of that user's group memberships.

* Service instances cannot be created for any broker that is registered with a name longer than 63 characters.
