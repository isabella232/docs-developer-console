These are release notes for <%= vars.product_full %>.

## <a id="0-4-0"></a> v0.4.0–alpha.4

**Release Date:** MONTH DAY, 2020

<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change:</strong>
  The custom resource definition (CRD) <code>CloudFoundry</code>
  has been renamed as <code>CloudFoundryAPI</code>.
  You must ensure that your <code>cf.yaml</code> file references <code>CloudFoundryAPI</code>.
  For more information, see <a href="./using-providing.html#register-cfs">Register a Cloud Foundry Deployment</a>.
</p>

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

* Access to resources within registered Cloud Foundries is now controlled at a space level and access must now
be granted explicitly. For more information, see
[Grant a Cloud Foundry Space Access to a Project](./using-providing.html#grant-space-access).

* **Improved output for `pdc` commands:**
The `pdc binding list` and `pdc instance get` commands return the bound app for a binding.

### Resolved Issues

This release has the following fixes:

* **Broker names are validated:**
<%= vars.product_short %> now prevents the creation of brokers with names longer than 63 characters.
  You cannot create service instances for a broker registered with a name longer than 63 characters.

* **App and binding names are validated:**
When you create a binding, <%= vars.product_short %> now verifies if the app and binding names combined
are longer than 49 characters.
If the combined names are longer than 49 characters, the bind fails fast with a descriptive message.

### Known Issues

This release has the following issues:

* If `REGISTRY-PASSWORD` contains a `$` character, installing CNAB fails.
For more information, see [Install the CNAB](installing.html#install-cnab).

* If you remove a user's last remaining group membership in a backing identity provider, such as
LDAP, the User Account and Authentication (UAA) server does
not reflect this change.
This can result in the UAA server generating tokens for users that grant permissions for groups that
the users are not in anymore.
This is a UAA issue.
To prevent this issue, create a group that grants no permissions and assign a user to that group before
removing the rest of that user's group memberships.


## <a id="0-3-1"></a> v0.3.1–alpha.3

**Release Date:** April 15, 2020


### Features

New features and changes in this release:

* You can register Cloud Foundry deployments with <%= vars.product_short %>.
You can then retrieve the registered Cloud Foundry deployments by running `pdc cloudfoundry list`.<br>
For more information, see [Register a Cloud Foundry Deployment](./using-providing.html#register-cfs).

* You can wire a service instance provisioned through <%= vars.product_short %>
to an app in a registered Cloud Foundry deployment by passing an additional flag of the form
`--app=CF-NAME/ORG-NAME/SPACE-NAME/APP-NAME` to `pdc binding create`.<br>
For more information, see
[Bind a Service Instance to an App That Runs in Cloud Foundry](./using-provisioning.html#bind-instance-to-cf).

* The Kubernetes API group for projects is now `projects.pivotal.io`.

* You can provide optional service-specific parameters when creating a new service instance or binding by using the flag
`--parameters=PARAMETERS-AS-JSON`.<br>
For more information, see
[Create a Service Instance](./using-provisioning.html#create-instance)
or [Bind a Service Instance to an App That Runs in Cloud Foundry](./using-provisioning.html#bind-instance-to-cf).

### Known Issues

This is a UAA issue.
To prevent this issue, create a group that grants no permissions and assign a user to that group before
removing the rest of that user's group memberships.

* You cannot create service instances for a broker registered with a name of more than 63 characters.

* Binding to a Cloud Foundry app fails if the app name and the binding name combined have more than 49
characters.
